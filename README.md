# TransitionsListener

This gem was inspired by [State Machine](https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine)
to listen all state transitions and make actions before and after the transition is saved.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'transitions_listener'
```

And then execute: ```bundle install```


## Usage 
```ruby
# == Schema Information
#
# Table name: articles
#
#  id              :bigint
#  state           :string
  
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  include TransitionsListener
  listen_transitions :state do
    after_transition from: :active, to: :inactive do |article, transition|
      # article.send_inactive_email
    end
    before_transition from: any, to: :deleted do |article, transition|
      # article.errors.add(:base, "not possible") if article.active_carts.any?
    end
    
    before_transition({ from: any, to: any }, if: :valid_article?, unless: :destroyed?, callback: :any_to_any_callback)
  end
  
  def any_to_any_callback
    puts "any to any callback called"
  end
  
  def valid_article?
    true
  end
  
  def destroyed?
    false
  end
end
```

## API
- ````listen_transitions(attr_name){block}````   
    permit to define state transitions listener for a specific model attribute

-   Before update   
    ````before_transition(states, if: :action?, unless: :action?, callback: :action) { block }````   
    Permit to listen transitions before the new state is saved
    * states: (Mandatory) State Transition(s) to listen for
    * if: (Optional) Positive conditional action(s) to execute callback. Sample: ```if: :deleted? | if: [:deleted?, :ready?]```  
    * unless: (Optional) Negative conditional action(s) to execute callback. Sample: ```unless: :deleted? | unless: [:deleted?, :ready?]```
    * callback: (Optional) Model method to be called as a callback (Will be overridden If block is defined)

-   After update (Args are similar to before update)   
    ````after_transition(states, if: :action?, unless: :action?, callback: :action){ block }````   
    permit to listen transitions after the new state was saved


States can be defined as the following:
- ```before_transition(from: any, to: any){}``` block will be called when attr value is changed from any value to any value
- ```before_transition(from: any, to: :active){}``` block will be called when attr value is changed from any value to :active
- ```before_transition(from: :active, to: any){}``` block will be called when attr value is changed from :active value to any value
- ```before_transition(from: %i[active inactive], to: %i[deleted cancelled]){}``` block will be called when attr value is changed from :active or inactive to :deleted or :cancelled
- ```before_transition([{ from: :active, to: :inactive }, { from: :inactive: :deleted }]){}``` block will be called when attr value is changed from :active to :inactive or :inactive to :deleted
- ```before_transition([{ active: :inactive, inactive: :deleted }]){}``` block will be called when attr value is changed from :active to :inactive or :inactive to :deleted (Shorter state definitions. Same as above)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
